Got it! If you want to animate only a number and start counting when it's in view (without animating the sections themselves), here's the updated solution. We'll keep the sections static and have the number animate (count from 0 to 100) only when it comes into view.

### Updated Code:

```jsx
import { useRef, useEffect } from "react";
import { useInView } from "framer-motion";
import { motion, useMotionValue, useTransform, animate } from "framer-motion";
import "./styles.css";

export default function App() {
  const count = useMotionValue(0);
  const rounded = useTransform(count, Math.round);

  const ref = useRef(null);
  const isInView = useInView(ref, { once: true });

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isInView) {
      const animation = animate(count, 100, { duration: 2 });
      return animation.stop; // Cleanup the animation on unmount
    }
  }, [isInView, count]);

  return (
    <div>
      <div style={{ padding: "50px" }}>
        Scroll down to see the number counting animation.
      </div>
      
      <motion.div
        ref={ref}
        style={{
          fontSize: "48px",
          fontWeight: "bold",
          color: "#007BFF",
          textAlign: "center",
        }}
      >
        {rounded}
      </motion.div>
      
      <div style={{ padding: "200px" }}>
        Scroll further for more content.
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **`useInView` for Number Animation**:
   - I've added `useInView` to track when the number element comes into view, and when it does, it starts the animation (counting from 0 to 100).

2. **No Animation on Sections**:
   - The section elements no longer animate, only the number will animate when it comes into view.

3. **Number Animation Logic**:
   - The number (`count`) animates from `0` to `100` using `animate(count, 100, { duration: 2 })` when the element is in view.

### Explanation:
- When you scroll down and the number element comes into view, the number will count from 0 to 100 over 2 seconds.
- The rest of the page remains static, and only the number animation is triggered when the component is visible.
